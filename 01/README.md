## revisiting my JS 
in day 01 i was refreshing on javascript reminding myself of the es6 syntax

learnt of higher order functions and using the ```Object``` which i didnt know was handy

#### self calling functions made my day i never knew there was such
```
;(function(n){
    console.log(`you didnt call me but i am returning ${n}`)
})(23)
```
